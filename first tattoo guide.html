    Think it through
Really! Think through what you want to have on your body forever! Ask yourself why you are getting tattooed in first place. Do you want to express yourself or you are just keen on having someone’s art on your body? Whatever your reason is, take your time to think about it.
After you have settled yourself on the idea that you indeed want permanent body art, start thinking of what you want. It doesn’t matter if you want something meaningful that marks moment of your life. Or you just saw a cool looking Halloween flash design of an artist that you follow on Instagram. Just. Think. It. Through.

Research the artist
After you have settled on whether you want tattoo comes the time to decide what style you want and who is the perfect person to do it.
If you have seen a tattoo that certain artist is offering as a “Flash design” its easy. You don’t have to think about whether this artist will be able to make the tattoo perfect. They have the idea already and you know how it’s going to look. Despite that, you still need to check out his tattoo portfolio and maybe some clients’ reviews. After that all you have to do is book an appointment.
However, if you have brief idea or your tattoo is something meaningful, you will have to do your homework. Research what other meanings your tattoo might have, research different styles and then, it’s time for you to settle on an artist. See who is the best artist available for the piece you desire. Browse their portfolio or social media account. If possible, talk to people who have been tattooed by them. Look at the tattoo shop reviews and lastly, don’t be afraid to ask for consultation with them.

Contact the artist
The artist that you like might offer consultations or walk ins. If you want something small, like lines or lettering you can settle for a walk in. However, if you have something bigger or more complicated you should contact the artist. Book a consultation or talk it through email or social media. Be ready with reference pictures, but mind that your artist will not make the same drawing or design. After all every tattooist is an artist and they have their own style, so they will not do the same piece twice or steal another person’s work.

Prepare yourself
Before your appointment you should prepare yourself mentally and physically. You might feel nervous, so talking with people that have tattoos might help you calm yourself. They can always give you useful advices.
Ask yourself one last time whether you want that tattoo. Its okay to postpone your appointment if you are not ready.
Before your appointment, ease up on the skincare products. Skip any products that can be unnecessary. The best thing is to have clean skin- clean of any products (especially fake tan), that’s going to make it easier for the artist to apply the ink directly to the skin.
Stay hydrated- drink water before and after your appointment. Restrain yourself from drinking caffeine or alcohol. Never show up to appointment intoxicated
Eat before your appointment. You should never show up hungry for getting tattooed. If your session is long (longer than 2 hours) ask your artist if you are allowed to bring snacks, they probably would even advice you to do that.

Be on time
Don’t be late for your appointment. Sure 5 minutes are alright, but preferably show up earlier. That will help you feel calm, you will have time to observe and get used to the surroundings. You can even chat with the other artists, ask them questions.
If you haven’t had an consultation with your artist, but you just chatted via social media or email, definitely go earlier, you probably will have to change somethings on the design if you haven’t seen it.



Be Comfortable
Make sure you are comfortable with the design and the placement. Don’t be afraid if you want to change something even after you had the stencil done. It’s important that you like everything about your tattoo.
If you are nervous, you can bring a friend. But don’t turn it into a party. 

Pay attention to after care
Your tattoo artist will tell you how to take care of your tattoo. Some artists will even provide you with lotions or cream. Don’t be afraid to ask them after the appointment if you are worried about something. 
The most common after care is to clean the tattoo if antibacterial soap or baby wipes and then apply cream to moisturize it. Mind that after few days the skin where the tattoo will start peeling and itching. Don’t scratch it, just apply moisturizer. 

It’s customary to tip 
Even though it’s optional, if you had good time and you are happy with the results it’s a good idea to tip your artist.
